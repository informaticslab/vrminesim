Mobile Virtual Reality Mine Safety Training iPad Prototype
===========
The CDC Informatics R&D Lab has collaborated with NIOSH (CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) in areas related to mobile applications that support the Institute’s Occupational Health objectives. For example, one such effort yielded a prototype that is a mobile device interface to the NIOSH Personal Protection Technology Laboratory’s Certified Equipment List data collection. More information on this prototype can be found here. In addition, the application can be directly downloaded to an iOS-based device from our App Lab here.

Prototype write-up is available through [PHIResearchLab.org](http://www.phiresearchlab.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=90:niosh-mine-safety-training-ipad-application&catid=1:prototypes&Itemid=3)
